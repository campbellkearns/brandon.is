When this goes live, I hope it looks good. What should we talk about here? Feelings or facts? Well to me, feelings are facts and the same is true for you. Are you wrong about how you feel? No. Your feeling may not be exactly reproducible in another and that (among other reasons) is why it isn't a fact.

I get better at writing the more I write. I get better at feeling the more I feel.
